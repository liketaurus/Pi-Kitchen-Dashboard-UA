#  :cloud: Pi Kitchen Dashboard (UA)
Localized (Ukrainian) version of Pi-Kitchen-Dashboard - based on [original Pi-Kitchen dashboard project](https://github.com/userexec/Pi-Kitchen-Dashboard)

What's differ:
* pure **Ukrainian** (text, weather condition and forecast, time/date formats etc.)
* **random background image** at startup (from [loremflickr.com](http://loremflickr.com))
* added [shell script](https://github.com/liketaurus/Pi-Kitchen-Dashboard-UA/blob/master/docs/run.sh) to **run dashboard in kiosk mode**

All files are in a [docs](https://github.com/liketaurus/Pi-Kitchen-Dashboard-UA/tree/master/docs) folder. Full instructions are [here](https://github.com/liketaurus/Pi-Kitchen-Dashboard-UA/blob/master/docs/README.md).
